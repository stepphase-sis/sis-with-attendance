      <h1>Student information system</h1>

      <p>
        A student information system (SIS), student management system, school
        administration software or student administration system is a management
        information system for education establishments used to manage student
        data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering
        students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts, results of
        student tests and other assessment scores; building student schedules;
        tracking student attendance; and managing many other student-related
        data needs in a school. Information security is a concern, as
        universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making
        them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those
        experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers. A major
        system in use within the UK is Capita's SIMS system. Other systems
        available include Arnor, Bromcom, Civica REMS, Cloud School, Engage,
        iSAMS, PowerSchool, RM Integris, ScholarPack, SchoolBase, SchoolPod and
        WCBS.
