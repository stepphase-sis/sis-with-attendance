  <h1>Student information system</h1>
  
  <p>
A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education establishments used to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts, results of student tests and other assessment scores; building student schedules; tracking student attendance; and managing many other student-related data needs in a school.
  
Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers.

A major system in use within the UK is Capita's SIMS system. Other systems available include Arnor, Bromcom, Civica REMS, Cloud School, Engage, iSAMS, PowerSchool, RM Integris, ScholarPack, SchoolBase, SchoolPod and WCBS.
